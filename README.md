# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

## Purpose

This project was created by me - Khaled Alkhatib as part of my learning journey at Lighthouse Labs.

## Final Product

A fully functioning Snake game with the ability of players to identify their snake by having their initials tagged to it as well as 
limited number of preset messages to be triggered and shown to other players.


## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the snek server repo to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.
